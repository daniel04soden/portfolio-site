## Why did I make this?

- This website served as both a means of proving my web development skills
- as an excuse to explore svelte as a front end compiler and seeing how easy it is to use for future projects in which I may need to quickly create a simple front end

## Roadmap for this site:

1. Blogging:

- I intend to start making static pages to this website in the form of blogs as a means of providing my opinion on ongoing topics in the Tech world.
- (This will likely become an early blog)

2. Project Updates:

- I have many project ideas lined up and I'd love to be able to mention them here as to hold myself accountable

3. Back-end...:

- For now this website is okay on its own, but given the content is mostly static
  and I am hosting it on Github codespaces, it shouldn't be a problem to not have a back-end
- If I were to ever need one, it would be for simple things like a Ticket system or commissions
